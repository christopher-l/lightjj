//
// Marker recognition (escalation-aware width discovery, exact-width matching,
// false-match defenses) lives in the shared scanner — conflict-markers.ts —
// the same core conflict-parser.ts runs on diff-wrapped lines. This file owns
// reconstruction policy: routing content lines into base/ours/theirs, side
// labels/refs, and parse-time blocks.
