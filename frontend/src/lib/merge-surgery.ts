// Pure position-surgery extracted from MergePanel.svelte — the thing that kept
// breaking in bughunter rounds. planTake() computes the change-spec + new
// tracked range; remapBlock() maps a tracked block through an arbitrary (user)
// doc change; blockCharRange() is the ONE line-range → char-offset conversion,
// done at the CodeMirror boundary.
//
// POSITION MODEL: tracked blocks are LINE ranges — 1-based, half-open
// [from, to), the same coordinate system as ChangeBlock (so seeding is the
// identity: a block's initial center range IS its bFrom/bTo). NOT character
// offsets. The char-offset model (pre-2026-08) picked leading-vs-trailing `\n`
// separators by inspecting characters around a zero-width offset, but a blank
// line is itself zero-width: "before the blank line", "the blank line", and
// "after the blank line" all aliased to ONE offset, so blank-line conflicts
// (the classic code-formatting merge) lost or misplaced lines — ~3.5% of
// random blank-inclusive shapes under fast-check. In the line model those are
// three distinct values ([n,n), [n,n+1), [n+1,n+1)) and the separator choice
// is pure arithmetic on (from, to, doc.lines): no character inspection, no
// oppEmpty disambiguation, no branch-order subtlety.
//
// The companion invariant lives in conflict-extract.ts: blocks index the
// split('\n') lines of each side, so a side is never zero lines ('' is ONE
// blank line) — the []-vs-[''] distinction that a joined string erases is
// carried by the block ranges instead.
//
// Pure over @codemirror/state types (Text, ChangeDesc) — no EditorView, no
// DOM, so testable in vitest without jsdom gymnastics.

 *  survived the edit: the next arrow click replaces exactly the block's
 *  lines, so an annexed neighbour would be silently destroyed (adversarial
 *  review 2026-08: "A/CCC/D", triple-click "CCC\n", Backspace → the block
 *  claimed "D"; ← theirs saved "A\nCCC").
 *
 *  Line-survival model, computed from the change's deleted ranges (old
 *  coordinates) rather than from where two content offsets happen to land:
 *   - a line is ALIVE if any of its content chars survives (a blank line has
 *     none: never alive, but it can't be damaged either);
 *   - deleting the \n between two lines MERGES them into one group. Only the
 *     group holding the block's first line can contain outsider lines before
 *     it (the p-side), only the one holding its last line outsiders after
 *     (the q-side); groups made of block lines alone stay the block's,
 *     whatever was typed into them (select the block's TEXT, retype it: still
 *     owned).
 *  THE INVARIANT (literally true, oracle-checked in MergePanel.test.ts): a
 *  shared line whose content chars were never deleted or typed into is never
 *  inside any block's range — whatever happened to the newlines around it.
 *  So a group with outsiders is NEVER the block's if any outsider with
 *  content is fully intact — even a plain JOIN (Backspace at the block's
 *  column 0, Delete at the end of the line above, Delete at the block's end)
 *  drops ownership: the block goes zero-line beside the merged line, and a
 *  re-take inserts beside it (visible duplicate the user can delete) rather
 *  than overwriting the neighbour — join-then-Enter otherwise re-split the
 *  text into its original shape with the shared line silently annexed.
 *  Otherwise the group is the block's iff some block line in it is alive
 *  (block content merged with an outsider the user themself damaged — the
 *  honest 'mixed' case); else NOT if any outsider is alive (block content
 *  gone → hands off); else (nothing alive: destroyed lines and blanks) iff
 *  the block had a blank line in it — "A/A/<blank block>", delete the middle
 *  "A\n": the block keeps its blank; "<blank>/CCC-block", delete "\nCCC":
 *  the shared blank stays shared. Blank outsiders carry no content a take
 *  could destroy, so they never veto.
 *  Owned groups map to new lines through mapPos with the asymmetric assoc
 *  (from=1: an Enter at the block's first column pushes the block down
 *  rather than absorbing the new line; to=-1: an Enter at its end leaves the
 *  new line outside) plus the zero-width inversion flip (typing INTO an owned
 *  blank line spans the insertion). No owned group ⇒ the block is now
 *  ZERO-line, a marker beside the merged line — on the far side from that
 *  line's survivor (alive p-side content → after it, alive q-side → before
 *  it, a plain join → after; among content-free lines an intact blank beats
 *  a destroyed line, so the marker never hops over a shared blank). Text typed
 *  as part of a wholesale line replacement ("CCC\n" → "X\n") is thus left as
 *  unowned shared text with the marker beside it: conservative — a later
 *  take re-inserts the side next to it instead of overwriting what the user
 *  typed.
 *
 *  Zero-line blocks are a marker behind the newline that ends line from-1:
 *  text typed at the end of the line above lands BEFORE the marker, text
 *  typed at column 0 of the line below lands AFTER it. If that newline
 *  survives, the marker stays right behind it; if it was deleted, the lines
 *  around the marker merged and the same survivor rule places it before or
 *  after the merged line. The two ends follow the same lean: from=1 is
 *  pinned to the top (everything typed lands after it), from=L+1 is pinned
 *  past the end (everything typed at EOF — even new lines — lands before it,
 *  exactly like typing at the end of the line above a mid-doc marker). They
 *  own nothing, so nothing can be annexed and merge-tracker never marks them
 *  'mixed'. */
